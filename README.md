# Enigma

Enigma is a German encryption machine used during the World War 2

This machine is very special, Enigma is composed of rotors and reflector

I tryhed to reproduce this encryption system in Python

At the beggining, I made it with only 2 rotors (instead of 3) and without reflector

(Thanks to the EFREI Engineering School Paris for giving me this topic !)
